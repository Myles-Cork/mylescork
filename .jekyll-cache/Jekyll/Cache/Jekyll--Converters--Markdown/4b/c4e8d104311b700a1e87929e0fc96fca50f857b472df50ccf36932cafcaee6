  <figcaption>Drift BUS wireframe gif animation</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Animation frames made with Blender, GIF animation made with Adobe Photoshop.</p>

<p>I made this animation as part of the <a href="/posts/2020-06-22-Drift-BUS-IRL/">Drift BUS IRL video</a>, and one of the frames was used for the <a href="/posts/2020-06-22-Drift-BUS-Shirt/">alternative Drift BUS shirt design</a>. It was made using blenderâ€™s procedural animation features, which allow animation using cyclic functions such as sine waves, and the freesytle export option, which gives it the wireframe look.</p>
