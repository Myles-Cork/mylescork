Animation frames made with Blender, GIF animation made with Adobe Photoshop.

I made this animation as part of the [Drift BUS IRL video](/3d%20animation/video%20production/blender/adobe%20premiere/Drift-BUS-IRL/), and one of the frames was used for the [alternative Drift BUS shirt design](/graphic%20design/blender/adobe%20illustrator/Drift-BUS-Shirt/). It was made using blender's procedural animation features, which allow animation using cyclic functions such as sine waves, and the freestyle export option, which gives it the wireframe look.
