# Privacy Policy

Myles Cork built the Drift Bus app as a commercial app. This app is provided by Myles Cork and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information through the use of the app or support contact at mylescorkapps@gmail.com.

If you choose to use this app, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The personal information that I collect is used for providing and improving the app. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this privacy policy.

## Information Collection and Use

Personal information is information that identifies you and that may be used to contact you online or offline. No personal information is collected directly through the use of the app by Myles Cork.

When contacting the support email, mylescorkapps@gmail.com, personal information such as your contact information, device type, and operating system may be collected. This information will be provided by you directly via email and will be used for the purposes of resolving the support request.

The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

## Log Data

I want to inform you that whenever you use my app, in case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device type, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my app, the time and date of your use of the app, and other statistics.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy

This app does not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case a child under the age of 13 contacts me directly for customer support, I will take additional steps to protect their privacy including requesting their legal guardians consent for the collection of personal information from the child for the purposes of the customer support request. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me at mylescorkapps@gmail.com to review or change the information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update the Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2021-06-20
