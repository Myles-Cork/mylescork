An HTML form that takes in a quote, author name, year, font style, font color, and background color, and then generates a formatted quote. Has a textfield, two checkboxes, a text box, a number box, three radio buttons, two color pickers, and a button. The textarea is a required field. The author and year text/number inputs can be turned off with the checkboxes, and there's logic for detecting missing input and defaults for both. The textarea can be resized, and the rest of the form adapts to its width (or the window size, whichever is smaller).
