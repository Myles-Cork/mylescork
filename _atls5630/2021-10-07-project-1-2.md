## Topic Recap
An exploration of [impossible 3D objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_object).

## Mockup

## Process
### Modeling
I modeled a Penrose triangle in Blender.

### Testing model-viewer

I had trouble with model-viewer, as it [does not support orthographic camera projections](https://github.com/google/model-viewer/issues/1101). I partially got around this by making the camera's field of view very small, and placing it very far from the object, approximating a orthographic projection. I wasn't very satisfied with the results, as it became very hard to find a good angle for the illusion to still hold, and even after many attempts at finding a good angle, it still has some signs of breaking the illusion. I also noticed that the edges of the model became more jagged as I was shrinking the fov.

### Testing Three.js

I then attempted to make a viewer using threejs with an orthographic camera. I used the following plugins:
https://threejs.org/examples/?q=orbit#misc_controls_orbit
https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader

I ran into many issues trying to load the libraries, as they are modules and not regular JS scripts. I switched to using a node.js server to host the site locally to avoid some of the security errors I was having when loading the models. I ended up running out of time and did not manage to get it rendering.

I plan on continuing with the model-viewer library, flushing out the rest of the website. If I have time afterwards, I will attempt to use three.js again.

### Resources

Here are a list of resources I plan on using for the website's content:

http://www.fink.com/papers/impossible.html
http://gershonelber.org/EscherForReal/
https://books.google.com/books?id=0jRa1a4pD5IC&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false
https://www.peterkovesi.com/projects/impossible/impossible.html

### MVP
The minimal viable product for the site is:
- Home page with links to informative pages (I want to have at least 4 of these)
- 3D models for each impossible object, viewable in browser
- Descriptions and image examples for each object
