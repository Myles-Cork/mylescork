I figured out the Three.js library enough to create an orthographic viewer for a model. The mockup can be found [here](/_pages/impossibleobjects/milestone1/).

I broke down the problem into more steps, as before I had trouble tackling multiple things at once. I started by making a scene and camera looking at a cube following [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/render-3d-objects-in-browser-drawing-a-box-with-threejs/).

I then added orbit controls using the [three.js docs as a guide](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls).

I then loaded the model following [this tutorial](https://discoverthreejs.com/book/first-steps/load-models/).

And finally I found out how to make the background transparent with [this stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20495302/transparent-background-with-three-js).

I made the size of the canvas adaptable using code from my lab 1, where I resized the button to be a square based on the smallest dimension of the window, see that [here](../2021-09-06-lab-1/).
