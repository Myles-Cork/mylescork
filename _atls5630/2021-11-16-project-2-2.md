## [Static Version](https://creative.colorado.edu/~myco6347/fwd/Projects/Project2m2/)

## Representation of State
State will be stored in two components:

- Mastermind
  - Stores the Settings as three numbers
- Game
  - Stores guesses as an array of objects each with a number and a list of colors indices, e.g.```{number: 1, colors: [1,2,3,4]}```. The number is the number of the guess, and the color indices are numbers corresponding to colors in ColorPicker and ColorPeg.
  - Stores the correct answer as a list of color indices.
  - Stores the currently selected color as a number.
  - Stores the current guess number.
