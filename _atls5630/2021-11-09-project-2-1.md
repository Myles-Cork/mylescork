Here are two ideas I have for the project. I would like to do the first idea (Project Idea 1, Mastermind), but would do the second if other group members would prefer it.

## Project Idea 1

### Topic:
A recreation and expansion of the ["Mastermind"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) game.

### Inspiration:
I played a version of the mastermind game for the first time with some friends recently and found it really fun. I thingk

### Intended Audience:
People who like logic puzzle games.

### Goal:
To recreate the original game (4 colors to guess, 6 possible colors, 12 attempts), but give the player some settings to change the difficulty of the game. The settings will include changing the number of colors to guess, the possible colors each item can be, and the number of attempts the player has.

### Content/Sources needed
Assets for the visual design will need to be made, such as images for the colored pegs. No external sources are needed.

## Project Idea 2

### Topic:
The [Eight Queens Puzzle}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle).

### Inspiration:
Another logic puzzle I think would be interesting to implement.

### Intended Audience:
People who like logic puzzle games.

### Goal:
An implementation of the Eight Queens Puzzle.

### Content/Sources needed
Assets for the visual design will need to be made, such as images for the queens. No external sources are needed.
