Music made for my game "Drift Bus"

Music made in GarageBand. Multiple versions of the track were made (one full version, three for the in game loops, and two for the trailer and app store pages).

Visualizer made in Blender. Uses the bus and speedometer assets from the Drift Bus game. The speedometer has 3 sets of bars, each with two key frames (short and long), which are animated between based on the music volume. Each set of bars corresponded to the music volume of different frequency ranges. Has a volumetric smoke-like material that shifts the volumetric noise textures that create it over time to give the effect of motion. The camera is orthographic, and has a depth of field effect that always focuses on the front of the bus. The digital timer and timer bar are updated via Python scripts ran directly in Blender.

Final video compiled from frames and color graded in DaVinci Relsolve.
