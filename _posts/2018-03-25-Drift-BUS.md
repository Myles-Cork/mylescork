A video made to be shared with other students at BU following a running joke about the BUS (BU Shuttle). I posted it on my YouTube channel to share it, where it gained traction and found a worldwide audience.

I had been wanting to learn how to mod GTAV and make a video using the Rockstar Editor, and noticed that one of the busses looked very similar to the BU Shuttle:

The want to learn more about video game modding and video production, the running jokes about the BUS, the resemblance between GTAV's bus and the BUS, and the fact that I had been getting into Eurobeat music at the time (known for being the perfect drifting music), combined to create my vision for "Drift BUS".

To make the video, I modified the handling of the bus in GTA to be have more mass, less traction, and more acceleration. I also replaced some textures in the game, and attached the bus to an invisible boat to make the amphibious bus section of the video (<a href="https://youtu.be/6Dp4GnhKUp8?t=278">4:37-5:33</a>, notice how the driver was sitting in the middle of the BUS, where the boat's driver seat was). The game was captured using the Rockstar Editor, and edited in Adobe Premiere.
