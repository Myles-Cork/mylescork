  <figcaption>A scene of hot air balloons floating over a forest. Has 3 view modes, orthogonal, perspective, and first person perspective. All models were created using "GL_QUADS", "GL_QUAD_STRIP" and "GL_TRIANGLE_FAN". The hot air balloons were created using quad strips and a polar equation cross section , and the trees were made with wavy triangle fans stacked with a cylinder for a trunk.</figcaption>
