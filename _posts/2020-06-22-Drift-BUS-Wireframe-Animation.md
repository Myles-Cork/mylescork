Animation frames made with Blender, GIF animation made with Adobe Photoshop.

I made this animation as part of the [Drift BUS IRL video](/posts/2020-06-22-Drift-BUS-IRL/), and one of the frames was used for the [alternative Drift BUS shirt design](/posts/2020-06-22-Drift-BUS-Shirt/). It was made using blender's procedural animation features, which allow animation using cyclic functions such as sine waves, and the freesytle export option, which gives it the wireframe look.
