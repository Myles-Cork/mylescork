Made as part of a job application. The assignment was to make a vector based 2D asset with animatable parts to be used in reference manuals.
I created a 3D model of the device in order to get the perspective as accurate as possible.

{% include gallery id="gallery0" %}

{% include gallery id="gallery1" caption="3D models and exported SVGs" %}

3D models made and exported as SVGs with Blender, final illustration made with Adobe Illustrator.
