Animation made with Houdini Apprentice. The terrain was procedually generated with SOP nodes, the destruction was simulated with the RBD solver, and the dust/dirt clouds were simulated with POP and pyro solvers. The materials, lighting, and rendering were done using Solaris and the Karma render engine.
